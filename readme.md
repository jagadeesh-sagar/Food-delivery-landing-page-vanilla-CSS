* **Fully Responsive:**  Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, ensuring a consistent experience across all platforms.
* **Vanilla CSS Implementation:**  Built using pure CSS, showcasing the power and flexibility of modern CSS techniques without relying on external libraries.
* **Semantic HTML Structure:**  Utilizes semantic HTML elements for improved accessibility and code maintainability.
* **CSS Best Practices:**  Employs CSS best practices, including a well-organized structure, reusable classes, and a clear typography system.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Food-delivery-landing-page-vanilla-CSS.git`
2. **Open the project:** Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your browser.


## Project Structure

* **`index.html`:** The main HTML file for the landing page.
* **`css/`:** Contains the CSS files:
    * **`general.css`:** Global styles and reusable components.
    * **`style.css`:**  Main styling for the landing page.
    * **`queries.css`:**  Media queries for responsiveness.
* **`img/`:** Contains all image assets used on the page.


## Key CSS Concepts Demonstrated

* **Flexbox:** Used for layout and alignment of elements.
* **Grid:**  Employed for creating complex grid layouts.
* **Mobile-First Approach:**  Styles are designed for mobile devices first and then adapted for larger screens using media queries.
* **Responsive Typography:**  Font sizes and line heights adjust dynamically based on screen size.
* **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):**  While not explicitly used in the current code, this project is a good candidate for implementing CSS variables for improved maintainability and theming.  (Consider this as a potential enhancement!)

## Future Enhancements

* **Implement CSS Variables:**  Introduce CSS variables to manage colors, font sizes, and other design elements more efficiently.
* **Interactive Elements:** Add more interactive elements, such as animations or transitions, to enhance user engagement.
* **Accessibility Improvements:**  Further refine the accessibility of the page by adding ARIA attributes and ensuring proper keyboard navigation.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:**  Conduct thorough cross-browser testing to ensure consistent rendering across different browsers.
